Professional Statement

My name is Ming Ni. I want to be a Cybersecurity Analyst.

I studied Electrical Control Engineering in Taiwan, and worked as a Software Testing Engineer for 2 years. Then I came to Germany to study, but dropped out due to family and personal reasons. I had 2 kids and couldn't find a job in software testing, so I worked in stores to make ends meet. Later, I found a job at a start-up to work in the office. During that time I was thinking about my career, a friend changed her career to cybersecurity, and I looked into her job. I got very fascinated, and after a while, I decided this is what I wanted to do.

I always liked computers, and with my experience in software testing, I grew more to enjoy finding bugs and loopholes. I am very aware of the quality of products, and I do know how it feels when the management team sees them differently. Having so many career paths, I am down to earth, eager to try different kinds of things, but always calculate the worst cases. From my early career, I had many chances to connect with customers and providers, so that I have good communication skills, which is also important. I am good at seeing things from different perspectives. I also love puzzles. Solving problems brings me great joy.

I am eager to protect people and companies' assets. Quality means not only a great product, but also the challenges it can withstand, and security is nowadays the most important quality.
